animal intelligence the higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence in the strict sense  they include those kinds of behaviour which cannot be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of perceptual inference  not only profiting by experience but learning by ideas  such intelligent actions show great individual variability  they are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the creature being nonplussed  they are not bound up with particular circumstances as instinctive actions are  but imply an appreciative awareness of relations  when there is an experimenting with general ideas  when there is  conceptual  as contrasted with  perceptual  inference  we speak of reason  but there is no evidence of this below the level of man  it is not  indeed  always that we can credit man with rational conduct  but he has the possibility of it ever within his reach  animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of this work  we are here concerned simply with the general question of the evolution of behaviour  there is a main line of tentative experimental behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence  and it has been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary enregistration of capacities of effective response  the advantages being that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free  if it chooses  for higher adventures  there is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of behaviour  that they have become at once more controlled and more definitely free agents  and that the inner aspect of the behaviour  experimenting  learning  thinking  feeling  and willing  has come to count for more and more   evolution of parental care mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which expresses itself at many levels  the tendency to bring forth the young at a well advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated with a decrease in the number of offspring  there is a british starfish called  luidia  which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year  and there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger eels and some other fishes  these illustrate the spawning method of solving the problem of survival  some animals are naturally prolific  and the number of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care  but some other creatures  by nature less prolific  have found an entirely different solution of the problem  they practise parental care and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction  this is a trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals  so much so that herbert spencer formulated the generalisation that the size and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of evolution to which the animal has attained  now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the safety of the young  and one of these is called viviparity  the young ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well advanced and more or less able to look after themselves  this gives the young a good send off in life  and their chances of death are greatly reduced  in other words  the animals that have varied in the direction of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of parental care  in other cases it may have worked the other way round  in the interesting archaic animal called  peripatus   which has to face a modern world too severe for it  one of the methods of meeting the environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many months within the mother  so that it is born a fully formed creature  there are only a few offspring at a time  and  although there are exceptional cases like the summer green flies  which are very prolific though viviparous  the general rule is that viviparity is associated with a very small family  the case of flowering plants stands by itself  for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity  the seed being embryos  an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and therefore a huge family  viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial animals  where the risks to the young life are many  and it finds its climax among mammals  now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals  the duckmole and two spiny ant eaters  lay eggs  i e  are oviparous  that the marsupials  on the next grade  bring forth their young  as it were  prematurely  and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch  while all the others  the placentals  show a more prolonged ante natal life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn young   there is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution  it has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life  it has been a progressive conquest of the environment    it is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea  the shallow water  brightly illumined  seaweed growing shelf fringing the continents  this littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water  earth and air all meet  where there is stimulating change  abundant oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation   illustration  the hoatzin inhabits british guiana the newly hatched bird has

affinities both with worms and with insects  it has a velvety skin  minute diamond like eyes  and short stump like legs  a defenceless  weaponless animal  it comes out at night  and is said to capture

even suck  the mother places them in the external pouch  and fitting their mouths on the teats injects the milk  after a time the young ones go out and in as they please   it is not an easy haunt of life  but none the worse for that  and it is tenanted to day by representatives of practically every class of animals from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals  the cradle of the open sea   the open sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area  it is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life  for there is no crowding  there is considerable uniformity  and an abundance of food for animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating  sea meadows  of microscopic alg  these are reincarnated in minute animals like the open sea crustaceans  which again are utilised by fishes  these in turn making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and toothed whales  it is quite possible that the open sea was the original cradle of life and perhaps professor church is right in picturing a long period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water to allow the floating plants to anchor  it is rather in favour of this view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes  spend their youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea  and only return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they have gained considerable strength of body  it is probably safe to say that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the shore of the sea and the open sea  the great deeps   a third haunt of life is the floor of the deep sea  the abyssal area  which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe  it is a region of extreme cold  an eternal winter  of utter darkness  an eternal night  relieved only by the fitful gleams of  phosphorescent  animals  of enormous pressure     tons on the square inch at a depth of   fathoms  of profound calm  unbroken silence  immense monotony  and as there are no plants in the great abysses  the animals must live on one another  and  in the long run  on the rain of moribund animalcules which sink from the surface through the miles of water  it seems a very unpromising haunt of life  but it is abundantly tenanted  and it gives us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the difficulties of the deep sea should have been so effectively conquered  it is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in relatively recent times  for the fauna does not include many very antique types  it is practically certain that the colonisation was due to littoral animals which followed the food dbris  millennium after millennium  further and further down the long slope from the shore  the freshwaters   a fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters  including river and lake  pond and pool  swamp and marsh  it may have been colonised by gradual migration up estuaries and rivers  or by more direct passage from the seashore into the brackish swamp  or it may have been in some cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually turned into freshwater basins  the animal population of the freshwaters is very representative  and is diversely adapted to meet the characteristic contingencies  the risk of being dried up  the risk of being frozen hard in winter  and the risk of being left high and dry after floods or of being swept down to the sea  conquest of the dry land   the terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents from the sea or from the freshwaters  we must recognise the worm invasion  which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil  the invasion due to air breathing arthropods  which led eventually to the important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors  and the invasion due to air breathing amphibians  which led eventually to the higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and family affection  besides these three great invasions  there were minor ones such as that leading to land snails  for there has been a widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to possess the dry land  getting on to dry land had a manifold significance  it implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen than there is dissolved in the water  but the oxygen of the air is more difficult to capture  especially when the skin becomes hard or well protected  as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry ground  thus this leads to the development of  internal surfaces   such as those of lungs  where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed by the blood  in most animals the blood goes to the surface of oxygen capture  but in insects and their relatives there is a different idea  of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of oxygen combustion  the living tissues  a system of branching air tubes takes air into every hole and corner of the insect s body  and this thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect s intense activity  the blood never becomes impure  the conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of locomotion which may be compared to punting  when the body is pushed along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum  and it also followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal tended to be compact  readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface trailing on the ground  an animal like a jellyfish  easily supported in the water  would be impossible on land  such apparent exceptions as earthworms  centipedes  and snakes are not difficult to explain  for the earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil  the centipede s long body is supported by numerous hard legs  and the snake pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached  methods of mastering the difficulties of terrestrial life a great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that locomotion becomes limited to one plane  namely  the surface of the earth  this is in great contrast to what is true in the water  where the animal can move up or down  to right or to left  at any angle and in three dimensions  it surely follows from this that the movements of land animals must be rapid and precise  unless  indeed  safety is secured in some other way  hence it is easy to understand why most land animals have very finely developed striped muscles  and why a beetle running on the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the sea  land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost  but these were met by defences of the most diverse description  from the hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals  from the carapace of tortoises to the armour of armadillos  in other cases  it is hardly necessary to say  the difficulties may be met in other ways  as frogs meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded retreat  another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young can no longer be set free anyhow  as is possible when the animal is surrounded by water  which is in itself more or less of a cradle  if the eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground  the chances are many that they would be dried up or devoured  so there are numerous ways in which land animals secure the safety of their young  e g  by burying them in the ground  or by hiding them in nests  or by carrying them about for a prolonged period either before or after birth  this may mean great safety for the young  this may make it possible to have only a small family  and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and the kindly emotions  thus it may be understood that from the conquest of the land many far reaching consequences have followed   illustration   photo  rischgitz   professor thomas henry huxley     one of the most distinguished of zoologists  with unsurpassed gifts as a teacher and expositor  he did great service in gaining a place for science in ordinary education and in popular estimation  no one championed evolutionism with more courage and skill    illustration  baron cuvier    one of the founders of modern comparative anatomy  a man of gigantic intellect  who came to paris as a youth from the provinces  and became the director of the higher education of france and a peer of the empire  he was opposed to evolutionist ideas  but he had anatomical genius    illustration  an illustration showing various methods of flying and swooping

fins used as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail  to some extent able to sail in albatros fashion   finally  it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life  because they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become burrowers and others climbers of trees  why some have returned to the water and others have taken to the air  it may be asked  perhaps  why the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and difficulties are so great  the answer must be that necessity and curiosity are the mother and father of invention  animals left the water because the pools dried up  or because they were overcrowded  or because of inveterate enemies  but also because of that curiosity and spirit of adventure which  from first to last  has been one of the spurs of progress  conquering the air   the last great haunt of life is the air  a mastery of which must be placed to the credit of insects  pterodactyls  birds  and bats  these have been the successes  but it should be noted that there have been many brilliant failures  which have not attained to much more than parachuting  these include the flying fishes  which take leaps from the water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights  holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a slight fluttering  there is a so called flying frog   rhacophorus   that skims from branch to branch  and the much more effective flying dragon   draco volans   of the far east  which has been mentioned already  among mammals there are flying phalangers  flying lemurs  and more besides  all attaining to great skill as parachutists  and illustrating the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his own  the power of flight brings obvious advantages  a bird feeding on the ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into the air  food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances  the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations  and birds in their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space  many of them know no winter in their year  and the migratory flight of the pacific golden plover from hawaii to alaska and back again does not stand alone  the procession of life through the ages  the rock record how do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were established on the earth  how do we know the order of their appearance and the succession of their advances  the answer is  by reading the rock record  in the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated into continents and depressed into ocean troughs  and the surface of the land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler hills and valleys  the high places of the land have been weathered by air and water in many forms  and the results of the weathering have been borne away by rivers and seas  to be laid down again elsewhere as deposits which eventually formed sandstones  mudstones  and similar sedimentary rocks  much of the material of the original crust has thus been broken down and worked up again many times over  and if the total thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts  according to some geologists  to a total of  miles  in most cases  however  only a small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place  for the deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time  the use of fossils when the sediments were accumulating age after age  it naturally came about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were buried  and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible to read the story of the past  by careful piecing together of evidence the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different sedimentary rocks were laid down  and thus to say  for instance  that the devonian period was the time of the origin of amphibians  in other cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the order of the strata when these have been much disarranged  for the simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more complex  there is no vicious circle here  for the general succession of strata is clear  and it is quite certain that there were fishes before there were amphibians  and amphibians before there were reptiles  and reptiles before there were birds and mammals  in certain cases  e g  of fossil horses and elephants  the actual historical succession has been clearly worked out  if the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and animals living at the time when the beds were formed  then it would be easy to read the record of the rocks  but many animals were too soft to become satisfactory fossils  many were eaten or dissolved away  many were destroyed by heat and pressure  so that the rock record is like a library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay   the geological time table the long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently divided into eras  thus  just as we speak of the ancient  medival  and modern history of mankind  so we may speak of palozoic  mesozoic and cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole  geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the process of evolution has taken  one of the methods is to estimate how long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea  for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to fall on the earth  dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is contributed every year in modern times  we get about a hundred million years as the age of the sea  but as the present rate of salt accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of the geological periods  the prodigious age just mentioned is in all likelihood far below the mark  another method is to calculate how long it would take to form the sedimentary rocks  like sandstones and mudstones  which have a  total  thickness of over fifty miles  though the  local  thickness is rarely over a mile  as most of the materials have come from the weathering of the earth s crust  and as the annual amount of weathering now going on can be estimated  the time required for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be approximately calculated  there are some other ways of trying to tell the earth s age and the length of the successive periods  but no certainty has been reached  the eras marked on the table  page   as  before the cambrian  correspond to about thirty two miles of thickness of strata  and all the subsequent eras with fossil bearing rocks to a thickness of about twenty one miles  in itself an astounding fact  perhaps thirty million years must be allotted to the pre cambrian eras  eighteen to the palozoic  nine to the mesozoic  three to the cenozoic  making a grand total of sixty millions  the establishment of invertebrate stocks it is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time  the archozoic and proterozoic eras  passed before there were living creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils  in the latter part of the proterozoic era there are traces of one celled marine animals  radiolarians  with shells of flint  and of worms that wallowed in the primal mud  it is plain that as regards the most primitive creatures the rock record tells us little   illustration   from knipe s  nebula to man    animals of the cambrian period e g  sponges  jellyfish  starfish  sea lilies  water

as  on the thumb  th    the rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build  but it must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and repeatedly changed by pressure and heat  so that the traces which did exist would be very liable to obliteration  and if it be asked what right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence or extreme rarity of fossils  we must point to great accumulations of limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous alg  and to deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron forming bacteria  ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants flourished in these ancient days   the era of ancient life  palozoic  the  cambrian  period was the time of the establishment of the chief stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges  jellyfishes  worms  sea cucumbers  lamp shells  trilobites  crustaceans  and molluscs  there is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago  for professor h  f  osborn points out that in the cambrian period there was already a colonisation of the shore of the sea  the open sea  and the deep waters  the  ordovician  period was marked by abundant representation of the once very successful class of trilobites  jointed footed  antenna bearing  segmented marine animals  with numerous appendages and a covering of chitin  they died away entirely with the end of the palozoic era  also very notable was the abundance of predatory cuttlefishes  the bullies of the ancient seas  but it was in this period that the first backboned animals made their appearance  an epoch making step in evolution  in other words  true fishes were evolved  destined in the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes  which are mere molluscs  in dominating the seas
